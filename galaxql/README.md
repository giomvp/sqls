My take on how to solve every problem in the interactive SQL tutorial used as part of an introductory course to the Big Data & Analytics Master program offered by EAE Business School/Universidad Politecnica de Catalunya.

This SQL tutorial aims to provide a practical and interactive learning experience to master SQL concepts and database operations. The tasks cover a wide range of SQL topics, including data retrieval, filtering, calculations, table creation and manipulation, subqueries, joins, transactions, triggers, and more.
